Before graduating, every Wayne State computer science student must pass
the Senior Design (ie Capstone) course (CSC 4996/4997). This work-intensive course is designed
to pair students with a number of 'real world' clients to deliver high-quality
software solutions. During the semester, we challenge our students to **Aim Higher** and take pride in
their projects. Students who successfully complete this course are better 
equiped to solve industry challenges and make impactful contributions
wherever they are employed.
