We rely on great clients to make the class a success. The main reason our 
class works so well is because we have amazing clients who put in the time 
to work with their student. Time is the main requirement
asked of our clients. We ask our sponsors to dedicate 1 hour a week to meet with the
students, explain the projects, answer questions, and give feedback. 

There is no monetary requirement for participating in this course. However, we have limited funding
for purchasing items in the course. So if your project requires special hardware or software,
the general expectation is for the client to provide the students with it. 
 
At the start of each semester, clients must submit a *1 pager* with a description
of the project and contact information. Since the students will ulimately vote on which
projects they want to participate in, we encourage clients to make the 1 pagers interesting
and enticing to the students. 

If you would like more information about the course or are interested in becoming
a sponsor, please contact Dr. Sam Bryfczynski ([sbryfcz@gmail.com](mailto:sbryfcz@gmail.com)) and/or 
Dr. Khayyam Hashmi ([eh2304@wayne.edu](eh2304@wayne.edu)). We'd be happy to hear your ideas and work
out a proper workload for a student team.
