In 2016, one of our student projects, Project Telehealth, won second place. Project Telehealth
is a mobile an app created to measure vital signs of patients with chronic diseases and communicate with doctors.
The team who created the application was Anthony Azzi and Jon Swiercyznski who commented, 
"We are very grateful to both Urban Science and Wayne State for providing us with this opportunity 
to learn and showcase our skills. The work was both challenging and difficult, and it feels awesome 
to be recognized by the College of Engineering as one of the top projects!"

In 2015, we had 2 teams finish in the top 3 at design day. First place went to Project Portia, an augmented 
reality motion comic book which was developed for the Wayne State University College for Creative Studies.
The student team consisted of Michael Simons, Mary Desjarlais, and Mahmoud Eraqi. Third place in 2015 went 
to the GM team who performed big data analysis to predict commodity pricing. This project created the infrastructure 
for a machine that has the ability to predict commodity pricing by leveraging Twitter as a big data 
source and utilizes an advanced sentiment analysis and taxonomy to determine market trends.
The student team consisted of Joshua Davis, Alex Czarnik , Maria Ferreria, Sravan Nerella, Mohammad Anwar, and Zaid Nackasha.
