Throughout the semester students are required to complete both detailed documentation 
as well as a complete final project.

## Documentation
1. **Development Plan** - This document describes how each student team plans on 
completing their assigned project. 
2. **Requirement Document** - After interacting with project sponsors, students collect
and create a detailed requirements document. This will form the basis for work they
must complete by the end of the semester.
3. **Design Document** - Once requirements have been collected, the student teams
must design out how they will build their software. This includes a wealth of 
diagrams showing the flow of the various use cases their solution must support.
4. **Test Plan** - The students must create a detailed test document demonstrating
how to test the many use cases inside of their application.
5. **Deployment Document** - Finally, the teams must document how to deploy their
software onto a new piece of hardware.

## Project Milestones
1. **Alpha** - Students must present a working prototype demonstrating that they understand 
the requirements and have connected all the major components.
2. **Beta** - Students present a near final version of their application. At this point,
the applications should be *feature complete* and all that is left is
testing, styling, and debugging.
3. **Final Presentation** - Students present their final project in a fully
working and tested state.
