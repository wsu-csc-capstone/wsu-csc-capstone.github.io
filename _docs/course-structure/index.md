This course is broken up into several general phases. The first
phase starts before the semester even starts. Dr. Khayyam Hashmi
and Dr. Sam Bryfczynski organize a set of projects for the students 
sponsored by external clients. There is usually a wide variety
of sponsors in many industries. A few examples are listed below.
* **Very Large Organizations** - General Motors and Fiat Chrysler)
* **Medium Sizes Organizations** - Urban Science
* **Startups** - Deelio
* **Academic** - Advaita

Each organization must come up with a 1 page summary of the 
system they would like their student team to develop. At this point
the semester begins. In one of the first classes, the students 
are presented with each 1 pager and given the opportunity to ask 
questions. After being presented with the project summaries, each
student force ranks the projects from top preference to last preference.

The instructors will then take the student preferences and 
match teams (sizing between 3-6 students) to each project. With this,
the student teams will meet, organize, and contact their clients.

Following this, students meet on a weekly basis with their clients
as they complete their [deliverables](/course-structure/deliverables/) 
throughout the semester culminating in a delivering a completed
application to their client.
