In addition to developing a application for a real world client, students must complete
an ethics part of this course. 

Each student is required to present a different section from our ethics textbook,
[A Gift of Fire](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Fire-Ethical-Computing-Technology/dp/0132492679).

This book explores the social, legal, philosophical, ethical, political, constitutional, and economic 
implications of computing and the controversies they raise. With a computer scientist's perspective, 
and with historical context for many issues, she covers the issues students will face both as members 
of a technological society and as professionals in computer-related fields. A primary goal is to develop 
computer professionals who understand the implications of what they create and how it fits into society 
at large. 

This part of the course gives students the opportunity to give a professional
presentation. We encourage the presenters to engage the rest of the class in 
a discussion about the topic presented.
