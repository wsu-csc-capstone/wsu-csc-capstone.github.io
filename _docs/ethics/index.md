In addition to developing a application for a real world client, students must complete
an ethics part of this course. 

Each student is required to present a different section from our ethics textbook,
A Gift of Fire. 

This part of the course allows student the opportunity to give a professional
presentation. We encourage the presenters to engage the rest of the class in 
a discussion about the topic presented.
